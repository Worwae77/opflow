Got it 👍 Here’s a **1-page executive summary** version of the specification, simplified and business-friendly for planning and stakeholder alignment:

---

# 📄 Executive Summary – OpFlow (n8n-based Ops Automation)

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **low-code automation platform** using **n8n** to streamline DevOps operational tasks (user onboarding, permission assignment, config management, secret rotation), enabling **self-service** for developers under strong governance.

---

## 🔑 Why This Matters

* **Reduce manual workload** → less repetitive CLI/API tasks.
* **Consistency & compliance** → approvals + audit logs.
* **Faster delivery** → developers get access/tools quickly.
* **Future-proof** → optional AI agent layer for natural language requests.

---

## 🛠️ What We Deliver (Phase 1 MVP)

* **Core Platform**: n8n (self-hosted in Docker/K8s, with PostgreSQL & Keycloak SSO).
* **Custom Connectors**: Jenkins, HashiCorp Vault, JFrog Artifactory, Ansible AWX, MCP.
* **Ready-made Workflows**:

  1. Developer onboarding (multi-tool access).
  2. Secret rotation (Vault).
  3. Temporary access provisioning.
  4. Jenkins agent provisioning (via AWX).
  5. Notifications (Slack/MS Teams).
* **Governance**: RBAC, approvals, Git-versioned workflows, immutable logs.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. Operator/developer triggers workflow (form, Slack command).
2. Workflow runs across multiple tools (Jenkins, Vault, JFrog, AWX).
3. Built-in approval gates ensure compliance.
4. Teams notified automatically.
5. Full audit trail stored in PostgreSQL + Git.

---

## 📌 Roadmap

* **Phase 1 (MVP)** → Core platform + connectors + baseline workflows.
* **Phase 2 (Enhancements)** → AI Agent Node (natural language → workflow), workflow catalog expansion, dashboards.
* **Phase 3 (Scale & AI Ops)** → Self-service portal, AI troubleshooting (log analysis, remediation suggestions), multi-team federation.

---

## ✅ Benefits

* **Easy to operate** (low-code drag & drop).
* **Maintainable** (template-based workflows, Git versioning).
* **Secure & auditable** (Vault + RBAC + approvals).
* **Flexible** (AI-driven extensions later without re-architecting).

---

⚡ In short: *OpFlow with n8n reduces manual DevOps work today, ensures compliance, and sets a foundation for AI-driven automation tomorrow.*

Do you want me to **also prepare a visual architecture diagram (high-level)** for this executive summary, so it’s easier to present in a meeting?
