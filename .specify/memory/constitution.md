# OpFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standard

The codebase MUST maintain high quality standards through:
- Consistent code style following industry best practices
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function
- Documentation for all public APIs and complex logic
- No duplicated code (maximum duplicated lines threshold of 3%)
- Regular code reviews with at least one approved reviewer

Rationale: High code quality ensures maintainability, reduces technical debt, and enables efficient collaboration among team members.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Protocol

All code changes MUST adhere to the following testing requirements:
- Minimum 80% unit test coverage for new code
- Integration tests for all API endpoints and critical user flows
- Performance tests for user-facing features
- All tests MUST pass before merging
- Test cases MUST include both positive and negative scenarios

Rationale: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, reduces regressions, and maintains system stability.

### III. User Experience Consistency

The project MUST maintain consistent user experience through:
- Standardized UI components and patterns
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
- Response time under 300ms for critical user interactions
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Consistent terminology across all user interfaces

Rationale: Consistent UX reduces user confusion, improves learnability, and enhances overall user satisfaction.

### IV. Performance Requirements

The system MUST meet the following performance criteria:
- Page load time under 2 seconds for 95th percentile
- API response time under 500ms for 99th percentile
- Memory usage not exceeding predefined thresholds per service
- CPU utilization below 70% under normal load
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization

Rationale: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, system reliability, and operational costs.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Propose changes through pull requests
2. Minimum 1-week review period for major changes
3. Requires approval from 2/3 of core maintainers
4. Changes MUST include rationale and impact analysis
5. Version number MUST be updated according to semantic versioning

### Version Control

- MAJOR version for incompatible governance/principle changes
- MINOR version for new principles or expanded guidance
- PATCH version for clarifications and non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

1. Quarterly review of adherence to principles
2. Automated checks where possible
3. Regular reporting on metrics and violations
4. Action plans for addressing non-compliance
5. Annual constitution review for relevance and updates
