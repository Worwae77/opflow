**Feature Branch**: `004-build-n8n-based`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the project from specification.md"

## Execution Flow (main)

```plaintext
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Full feature description available in specification.md
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: DevOps operators, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: workflow automation, access management, task orchestration
   ‚Üí Data: workflows, configurations, audit logs, permissions
   ‚Üí Constraints: governance, compliance, security
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected workflow execution SLA?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the data retention requirements for audit logs?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear user flows identified from executive summary
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Generated 15 testable requirements
   ‚Üí Marked 2 requirements needing clarification
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Identified 8 core entities with relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: "Spec has uncertainties around performance and retention policies"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: All completed (User Scenarios, Requirements)
- **Optional sections**: Included where relevant
- No N/A sections included

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps operator, I want to automate operational tasks through a low-code platform so that I can reduce manual workload while maintaining consistency and compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer joins the team, **When** the onboarding workflow is triggered, **Then** all required access and permissions are automatically provisioned with proper approvals

2. **Given** a secret rotation is scheduled, **When** the rotation workflow is initiated, **Then** the system updates all relevant secrets and notifies affected teams

3. **Given** temporary access is needed, **When** a user requests permissions, **Then** the system provisions time-limited access with automatic expiration

4. **Given** Jenkins agent capacity needs to be increased, **When** the provisioning workflow runs, **Then** new agents are automatically created and configured

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an approver is unavailable?
- How does the system handle workflow failures?
- What happens during system maintenance windows?
- How are concurrent workflow executions managed?
- What occurs if a dependent service is unavailable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web-based workflow creation interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support approval gates with configurable approvers
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain immutable audit logs
- **FR-005**: System MUST support Git versioning of workflow definitions
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with Keycloak for authentication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific SSO protocols required?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide workflow templates for common tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST support automatic secret rotation
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable temporary access provisioning
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide status monitoring and alerts
- **FR-011**: System MUST support parallel workflow execution
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement retry mechanisms
- **FR-013**: System MUST retain audit logs for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST notify users via configured channels
- **FR-015**: System MUST support custom tool integrations

### Key Entities

- **Workflow**: A sequence of automated tasks with approval checkpoints
- **Access Request**: Time-bound permission request with auto-expiration
- **Approval Gate**: Control point requiring authorized approval
- **Audit Record**: Immutable record of system activities
- **User Role**: RBAC definition for workflow access
- **Template**: Reusable workflow pattern
- **Integration**: Connection to external tools
- **Notification**: System-generated alert or message
