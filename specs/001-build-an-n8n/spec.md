## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a DevOps operator, I want to automate operational tasks through a low-code platform so that I can reduce manual workload while maintaining consistency and compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new developer needs access setup, **When** the onboarding workflow is triggered, **Then** all required access and permissions are automatically provisioned with proper approvals.

2. **Given** a secret rotation is due, **When** the rotation workflow is initiated, **Then** the system updates all relevant secrets in Vault and notifies affected teams.

3. **Given** temporary access is required, **When** a user requests temporary permissions, **Then** the system provisions time-limited access with automatic revocation.

4. **Given** new Jenkins agents are needed, **When** the provisioning workflow runs, **Then** AWX automatically creates and configures the agents.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an approval step times out?
- How does the system handle partial workflow failures?
- What happens when prerequisites for a workflow are not met?
- How are concurrent workflow executions handled?
- What happens during system maintenance or tool unavailability?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web-based interface for workflow creation and management
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with Keycloak for SSO authentication
- **FR-003**: System MUST support custom connectors for Jenkins, Vault, Artifactory, AWX, and MCP
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement role-based access control (RBAC) for workflow execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide approval gates with configurable approvers
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain immutable audit logs of all workflow executions
- **FR-007**: System MUST support Git versioning of workflow definitions
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable notification delivery via Slack and MS Teams
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide workflow templates for common operational tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement automatic secret rotation capabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST support temporary access provisioning with automatic expiration
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide status monitoring and alerting for workflow executions
- **FR-013**: System MUST support parallel workflow execution
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement retry mechanisms for failed workflow steps
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide detailed logging and troubleshooting capabilities

### Key Entities

- **Workflow**: A defined sequence of automated actions with approval gates and notifications
- **Connector**: Integration point with external tools (Jenkins, Vault, etc.)
- **Approval Gate**: Checkpoint requiring authorized user approval to proceed
- **Audit Record**: Immutable log of workflow execution including approvals and outcomes
- **Access Request**: Time-bound request for system permissions
- **Notification**: Alert or message sent to users/teams via configured channels
- **Secret**: Sensitive information managed through HashiCorp Vault
- **User Role**: RBAC definition controlling workflow access and execution permissions
